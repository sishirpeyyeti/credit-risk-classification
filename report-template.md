#Credit Risk Analysis Report

The purpose of this assignment was to determine loan risk using a prediction model. I did so by splitting the given data into traning and testing sets, and then used logistic regression to predict. Overall, the logistic regression model is the ideal model to use. This is due to the fact that in this model, the healthy loan has a precision of 100% and the high risk loan has a precision of 86%, indicating that generally, this model is a viable and accurate tool. I would recommend using this model in normal scenarios to determine loan risk.
